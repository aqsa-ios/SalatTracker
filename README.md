Salat Tracker

Seasonal Habit And Reflection iOS App

Salat Tracker is a SwiftUI-based habit tracking application designed around a high-engagement 30-day behavioral cycle. The app focuses on consistency, streak reinforcement, and emotional context, combining progress visualization with scalable architecture to support future expansion.

Problem

During high-intention periods such as Ramadan, users aim to build consistent daily habits but often struggle with maintaining streaks, tracking completion clearly, and staying emotionally connected to their goals. Existing tools either focus solely on reminders or lack structured progress reinforcement and reflection.

Hypothesis

If users can visually track daily completion, maintain streaks, and associate habits with emotional or reflective context, consistency and long-term engagement will improve.

Product Goals

Encourage structured daily consistency

Reinforce streak-based behavioral motivation

Provide emotional and reflective context
